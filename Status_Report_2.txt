
What have I completed?

	So far I have completed the intital steps for the user to comeplete, those being picking out what package and genre the user wants. 
	I have also defined all of my varaibles.


Next Steps?

	My next step, I want to create the list of video games that the program will choose from. I need an action games list and a chill games list.


Problems:

	So far I haven't had any problems. I do think I need help on how to create the lists and what would be the best way of importing them to my python code.
